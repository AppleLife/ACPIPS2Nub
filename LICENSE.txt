engineered from the equivalent binary code present in the
AppleACPIPlatformExpert.kext.  This original code is intended to be used as
part of the Darwin OS and is licensed under the terms of the Apple Public

If APSL licensing is not acceptable for you contact me (David Elliott) and
I'll consider granting an alternate license.
